   - Ensure that `messages`, `messaging_optins`, and `messaging_postbacks` are selected for this subscription.

## Step 7: Get Your Page Access Token
1. **Retrieve Token:**
   - Go back to the "Access Tokens" section.
   - Copy the generated Page Access Token.

## Step 8: Enter Page Access Token
1. **Configure Bot with Token:**
   - Paste the Page Access Token into `token.txt`.

## Step 9: Test Your Messenger Bot
1. **Test Bot Functionality:**
   - Open your connected Facebook Page.
   - Send a message to your page from a different Facebook account or just send "help" to check available commands.
   - Make sure that the account you will use to test the bot has a role in the app.

## Note:
- The bot will only respond to accounts that have specific roles assigned within the app.

   - Navigate to the dashboard or "My Apps" section to find your app.
   
3. **Select "App Roles":**
   - Once you've accessed your app's dashboard, look for a section or tab labeled "App Roles" or "Roles and Permissions".
   
4. **Add Roles:**
   - Within the "App Roles" section, you should see options to add or manage roles.
   - Click on the "Add Role" or similar button to start adding roles.
   
5. **Define Role Details:**
   - Specify the name and permissions associated with the new role you want to add. You can create custom roles tailored to your app's requirements.
   
6. **Assign Roles to Users:**
   - After defining the role, you can assign it to specific users associated with your app. You may need to provide the user's name or user ID to assign the role.
